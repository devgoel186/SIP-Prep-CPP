# Heaps

- Min Heap
- Max Heap
- Swapping operation to maintain the heap structure is called **Heapify**.
- The STL form of heaps is Priority Queues
- Max Heap : `priority-queue<int, vector<int>>`
- Min Heap : `priority-queue<int, vector<int>, greater<int>>`

## Priority Queue

- push = O(log n)
- pop = O(log n)
- top = O(1)
- size = O(1)
