## XOR Linked List (Space Efficient Storage for DLL)

An ordinary Doubly Linked List requires space for two address fields to store the addresses of previous and next nodes.

Now there is a memory-efficient version of Doubly Linked List that can be created using only one space for the address field with every node. This memory efficient Doubly Linked List is called XOR Linked List or Memory Efficient as the list uses bitwise XOR operation to save space for one address. In the XOR linked list, instead of storing actual memory addresses, every node stores the XOR of addresses of previous and next nodes.

There are other variations of storing lists like

- Self Organizing Lists
- Skip Lists
